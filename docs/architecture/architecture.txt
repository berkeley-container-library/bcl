# BCL Architecture Design Document

## "Minimal Compilation Unit" Design

BCL is designed to maximize the use of inlining.  One way it tries to accomplish
this is by minimizing the number of compilation units.  All BCL functions are
declared `inline` (1) so that the compiler might more readily choose to inline
them, since it isn't forced to create external linkage, and (2) to avoid
creating external linkage.  (2) will allow each compilation unit to define its
own inlined functions.

BCL is currently implemented only in header files (we will soon move variables
to a single compilation unit).

## Header Include Order

1) GlobalPtr.hpp, GlobalRef.hpp
   * Defines pointers, references.
   * References forward declare `rget`, and `rput`.
2) {backend}/backend.hpp
   * Uses global pointers, defines `read`, `write`, etc.
     See docs/backends/backend.txt for details.
3) comm.hpp
   * Defines `rget`, `rput`, etc.  Uses backend functions.
4) teams.hpp
   * If it has not already been included.
   * Does not including anythign else; forward declares backend `rank`, `nprocs`
5) util.hpp
   * Utilities, may use anything in core, etc.

## Global Variables

Global variables include:

uint64_t shared_segment_size;
void *smem_base_ptr;

(owned by BCL Core)

bool bcl_finalized;

uint64_t my_rank;
uint64_t my_nprocs;

(owned by backend -- backends may also allocate other global variables)
